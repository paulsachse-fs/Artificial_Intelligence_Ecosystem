# AI Image Processing and Classification Project

This project is designed to give you hands-on experience working with an image classifier and enhancing your programming skills using AI assistance. The project has two parts, each focused on different aspects of image classification and processing. By the end, you'll have explored fundamental concepts like Grad-CAM, image classification, and creative image filtering.

PART 1

3.3 Python Reflection - Base Classifier
While reviewing the explanations as someone who has never worked with python, the explanations were clear. Python appears very readable and syntactically does not seem to differ too much from C++. With this, I believe python will be a logical next language to understand and eventually master.

3.4 Top 3 Predictions
    1: bath_towel (0.23)
    2: bathtub (0.09)
    3: mongoose (0.06)

6 Analyze the Heatmap
When looking at my output, which I left as a side-by-side result rather than a single image with the heatmap overlay as a preference, the AI was clearly not able to distinguish one subject. It seems to be drawn to the pattern on the blanket, but misses the main subject (dog) completely. In fact, the model seemed to miss the head of the subject almost entirely and was instead drawn to the busiest part of the image.

PART 2

1.3 Reflect on AI Explanation of Basic Filter
The AI's description of the filter code was easy to follow, despite being a novice python user. This was due, in part, to the fact that the code was already fairly short and readable. Still, being able to look at a block of code for the first time and read it like plain English is a testament to the language and explanations from artificial intelligence make learning the language along with best practices a delight. 

1.4 Blur Observations
The blur was easily applied with no additional work from the user and looks like a high quality gaussian blur from a professional editing application. I suspect part of this quick and easy processing is a result of resizing the image early in the process. The "amount" of blur could also be easily turned up or down by modifying the radius value of the gaussian blur effect. Overall, this seems to be a reliable and easy to use tool.
